-- eCommerce Simulation - No Hints---
-------------------------------------
-- Summary
-- Let's simulate an e-commerce site. We're going to need users, products, and orders.
-- Users need a name and an email.
-- Products need a name and a price
-- Orders need a ref to product.
-- All 3 need primary keys.
-- Instructions
-- Create 3 tables following the criteria in the summary.
-- Add some data to fill up each table.
-- At least 3 users, 3 products, 3 orders.
-- Run queries against your data.

CREATE TABLE users
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR
(100),
    email VARCHAR
(100)
);

INSERT INTO users
    ( name, email )
VALUES
    ("Jim Brown", "jimbrown@email.com"),
    ( "John Brown", "johnbrown@email.com"),
    ( "Jane Brown", "janebrown@email.com");

SELECT *
FROM users;
-----------------------------
CREATE TABLE products
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR
(100),
    price INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO products
    ( name, price )
VALUES
    ("Shoes", 50),
    ("Shirt", 20),
    ("Pants", 30);

SELECT *
FROM products;
-----------------

CREATE TABLE orders
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users
(id),
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products
(id) 
);

INSERT INTO orders
    ( user_id, product_id )
VALUES
    (1, 3),
    (2, 2),
    (3, 1);
---------------------
-- Get all products for the first order.
select *
from orders
WHERE id = 1;

-- Get all orders.
select *
from orders;

-- Get the total cost of an order ( sum the price of all products on an order ).
/* select * FROM ORDERS WHERE id=1; */
select SUM(price)
from products
where name = "Shoes";

-- Add a foreign key reference from Orders to Users.
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN parent_id INTEGER
REFERENCES users
(id);
